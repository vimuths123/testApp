## About the app
This is a simple url shortener like https://cutt.ly/
## How it works
- In first page ('/') you can add a url and the app will generate short url for you.
- And when you goes to the url (localhost/XZ1AC or example.com/XZ1AC) the app will redirect to the url you first gave.
- The database saves the timestamp when the user has created the url and last time a user visited the shortened link.
